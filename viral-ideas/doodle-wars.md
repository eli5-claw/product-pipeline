# 🎨 AI Doodle Wars - Pictionary vs AI

## The Idea
A mobile game where you draw something, AI guesses what it is, then AI draws something, YOU guess what it is. But the AI is... not very good. And that's the fun.

## The Game

### How It Works

**Round 1: You Draw**
- Get a prompt: "Draw a dragon"
- You draw (badly, because touchscreen)
- AI guesses: "Is it... a snake wearing a party hat?"
- You laugh

**Round 2: AI Draws**
- AI gets a prompt: "Draw a pizza"
- AI generates abstract chaos
- You guess: "Is it a... pizza?"
- AI: "No, it was a pizza. You got it!"
- You: "That was luck"

**Round 3: Chaos Mode**
- Both draw at the same time
- AI tries to sabotage you
- You try to confuse the AI
- Hilarity ensues

## The AI "Art Style"

The AI doesn't draw well on purpose. It creates:

**Abstract Masterpieces:**
- A "cat" that looks like a potato with legs
- A "car" that's just a rectangle with circles
- A "house" that defies physics

**Overconfident Guesses:**
- Your drawing of a dog → "That's clearly a refrigerator"
- Your beautiful sunset → "Is this... anxiety?"
- Your attempt at a face → "A very sad pancake"

**Chaotic Energy:**
- The AI draws prompts literally: "Draw a hot dog" = dog on fire
- Or too abstract: "Draw love" = just a scribble
- Or cursed: "Draw a baby" = nightmare fuel

## Game Modes
