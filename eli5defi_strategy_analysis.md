## Conclusion

1. **Educate before selling** - The product should feel like a natural extension of the educational content
2. **Simplicity is the differentiator** - If it can't be explained in an ELI5 thread, it's too complex
3. **Community-first** - Build with the audience, not for them
4. **Authenticity over hype** - The audience trusts Eli5DeFi because they don't oversell

The ideal micro-product for this audience is one that **saves them time, reduces complexity, or helps them make better decisions** in DeFi.
