## browser-use/browser-use
• **Summary:** Make websites accessible for AI agents — browser automation framework for AI-driven web tasks
• **Link:** https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** This is the #1 trending AI project of 2025 with 74K+ stars, representing a paradigm shift from "AI demos" to "AI systems." It enables AI agents to navigate websites, fill forms, and perform complex web tasks autonomously. The framework integrates with Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients, making it essential infrastructure for the emerging agentic web.

## getzep/graphiti
• **Summary:** Build Real-Time Knowledge Graphs for AI Agents with temporal awareness
• **Link:** https://github.com/getzep/graphiti
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Graphiti addresses a critical gap in AI memory systems by building temporally-aware knowledge graphs that evolve in real-time. Unlike traditional RAG which relies on batch processing, Graphiti supports incremental updates and maintains historical context — essential for developing context-aware AI applications. It powers Zep's State-of-the-Art Agent Memory platform.

## resemble-ai/chatterbox
• **Summary:** State-of-the-art open-source text-to-speech models with zero-shot voice cloning
• **Link:** https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox
• **Category:** AI/ML Tools
• **Why it matters:** Chatterbox delivers production-grade TTS with Chatterbox-Turbo (350M params) achieving sub-200ms latency — competitive with ElevenLabs and Cartesia. The model supports 23+ languages and includes paralinguistic tags ([laugh], [cough]) for natural speech. Built-in neural watermarking ensures responsible AI deployment.

## jlowin/fastmcp
• **Summary:** The fast, Pythonic way to build Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients
• **Link:** https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp
• **Category:** Developer Tools / AI Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** FastMCP is the standard framework for MCP — the protocol that's becoming the "USB-C for AI agents." With 1M+ daily downloads and powering 70% of MCP servers, it simplifies connecting AI agents to tools and data. The framework auto-generates schemas, validation, and documentation from Python functions.

## virattt/ai-hedge-fund
• **Summary:** An AI Hedge Fund Team — multi-agent system simulating legendary investors
• **Link:** https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund
• **Category:** AI/ML / FinTech
• **Why it matters:** This educational project demonstrates the power of multi-agent AI systems by simulating 18 different investment personas — from Warren Buffett to Cathie Wood. Each agent contributes unique perspectives (value, growth, technical analysis, sentiment) to collective trading decisions. It's a compelling example of agent collaboration and emergent intelligence in financial decision-making.
