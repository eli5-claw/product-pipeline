## browser-use/browser-use
• **Summary:** Make websites accessible for AI agents — the leading open-source browser automation framework
• **Link:** https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** With 74K+ stars and the #1 spot on FAUN.dev's 2025 developer tools list, browser-use is redefining how AI agents interact with the web. It enables LLMs to automate browser tasks with human-like precision, from form-filling to complex multi-step workflows. The framework supports custom tools, MCP integration, and offers both local and cloud deployment options.

## camel-ai/owl
• **Summary:** Multi-agent collaboration framework achieving #1 on the GAIA benchmark
• **Link:** https://github.com/camel-ai/owl
• **Category:** AI/ML Multi-Agent Systems
• **Why it matters:** OWL (Optimized Workforce Learning) is a cutting-edge multi-agent framework built on CAMEL-AI that achieves 69.09% on the GAIA benchmark — ranking #1 among open-source frameworks. It enables specialized agents to collaborate through browsers, terminals, function calls, and MCP tools. Recently accepted at NeurIPS 2025, it represents a significant leap in agentic AI orchestration.

## getzep/graphiti
• **Summary:** Build real-time knowledge graphs for AI agents with temporal awareness
• **Link:** https://github.com/getzep/graphiti
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure / Databases
• **Why it matters:** Graphiti addresses a critical gap in AI memory systems by building temporally-aware knowledge graphs that continuously integrate dynamic data without batch recomputation. Unlike traditional RAG, it supports incremental updates, bi-temporal data models, and hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword + graph). With sub-second query latency and MCP server support, it's becoming the backbone for stateful AI applications.

## kagent-dev/kagent
• **Summary:** Cloud-native AI agent framework for Kubernetes
• **Link:** https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent
• **Category:** DevOps / Cloud Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Kagent brings AI agents natively into Kubernetes, the world's most popular workload orchestrator. It provides a declarative way to build, deploy, and manage agents using Kubernetes custom resources. With built-in MCP tool support for K8s, Istio, Helm, Argo, Prometheus, and Grafana, it's pioneering the convergence of AI agents and cloud-native infrastructure. Currently in CNCF sandbox review.

## elys-network/elys
• **Summary:** DeFi Proof-of-Stake blockchain bridging Web2 and Web3 trading experiences
• **Link:** https://github.com/elys-network/elys
• **Category:** DeFi / Blockchain
• **Why it matters:** Elys Network is a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain that combines the seamless UX of centralized exchanges with DeFi's non-custodial benefits. It offers perpetual trading, spot trading, and liquidity provision in a single platform.
