## ElizaOS
• **Summary:** Autonomous AI agents for everyone — an extensible platform for building and deploying AI-powered applications with crypto/blockchain integration.
• **Link:** https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza
• **Category:** DeFi/Blockchain/AI
• **Why it matters:** ElizaOS has emerged as the leading framework for creating AI agents that can autonomously interact with blockchain protocols, execute token swaps, and make real-time DeFi decisions. With the rise of AI-driven trading and autonomous agents in crypto, this represents a paradigm shift where AI doesn't just analyze markets — it actively participates in them.

## Dify
• **Summary:** Production-ready platform for agentic workflow development — build, deploy, and manage AI applications with visual workflows.
• **Link:** https://github.com/langgenius/dify
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Dify bridges the gap between AI prototypes and production deployments with an all-in-one toolchain. It supports RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, and tool-using agents while remaining self-hostable. As enterprises rush to deploy AI agents, Dify offers the infrastructure backbone that makes production AI accessible without vendor lock-in.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)
• **Summary:** Open protocol enabling seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources, tools, and services.
• **Link:** https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** MCP is becoming the "USB-C for AI applications" — a standardized way for LLMs to connect to databases, APIs, and tools. With Microsoft backing and rapid ecosystem growth (1200+ community servers), it's solving the fragmentation problem that has plagued AI integrations. This protocol could define how AI agents interact with the world.

## Ollama
• **Summary:** Get up and running with large language models locally — run Kimi-K2.5, DeepSeek, Qwen, and other models on your own hardware.
• **Link:** https://github.com/ollama/ollama
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Ollama democratizes access to frontier AI by making local LLM deployment trivially easy. With 160k+ stars and support for the latest open models including GPT-OSS, it enables privacy-preserving AI, offline capabilities, and cost-effective scaling. For developers building AI agents that handle sensitive data or need air-gapped deployments, Ollama is essential infrastructure.

## Scaffold-ETH 2
• **Summary:** Ethereum development stack for rapid prototyping — everything you need to build, test, and deploy decentralized applications.
• **Link:** https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2
• **Category:** DeFi/Blockchain/Dev Tools
• **Why it matters:** Scaffold-ETH 2 combines NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, and Viem into a batteries-included Ethereum development environment. As the Web3 ecosystem matures, developer experience becomes the competitive advantage. This toolkit dramatically reduces the time from idea to deployed dApp, making it the go-to starting point for Ethereum builders.
