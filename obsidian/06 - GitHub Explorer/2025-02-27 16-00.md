## Graphiti
• **Summary:** Build Real-Time Knowledge Graphs for AI Agents
• **Link:** https://github.com/getzep/graphiti
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Graphiti is a framework for building temporally-aware knowledge graphs specifically designed for AI agents. Unlike traditional RAG approaches that rely on batch processing, Graphiti supports real-time incremental updates, bi-temporal data tracking, and efficient hybrid retrieval combining semantic embeddings, keyword search, and graph traversal. It powers Zep's state-of-the-art agent memory and demonstrates 100%+ accuracy improvements over traditional approaches with 90% latency reduction.

## kagent
• **Summary:** Cloud Native Agentic AI for Kubernetes
• **Link:** https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure + DevOps
• **Why it matters:** kagent is a Kubernetes-native framework for building, deploying, and managing AI agents. It treats Kubernetes as the orchestration platform for AI workloads, providing declarative agent definitions via custom resources, MCP tool integration, and built-in observability with OpenTelemetry. This bridges the gap between AI agent development and production-grade infrastructure, making it easier to run AI agents at scale in cloud-native environments.

## FastMCP
• **Summary:** The fast, Pythonic way to build MCP servers and clients
• **Link:** https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp
• **Category:** Developer Tools / AI Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** FastMCP is the standard framework for working with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — the emerging standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data. With 1M+ daily downloads and powering 70% of MCP servers across all languages, it abstracts away protocol complexity, letting developers focus on logic while handling schema generation, validation, transport negotiation, and authentication automatically. It's the bridge between AI agents and the tools they need.

## Chatterbox
• **Summary:** SoTA open-source text-to-speech models by Resemble AI
• **Link:** https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox
• **Category:** AI/ML (Voice/TTS)
• **Why it matters:** Chatterbox is a family of state-of-the-art open-source TTS models including Turbo (350M params, 1-step diffusion), Multilingual (23 languages), and the original high-quality English model. Turbo achieves faster-than-realtime inference with native paralinguistic tags like `[laugh]`, `[cough]`, and `[chuckle]`. In blind evaluations, 63.75% of listeners preferred Chatterbox over ElevenLabs. All models include built-in neural watermarking for responsible AI deployment.

## browser-use
• **Summary:** Make websites accessible for AI agents
• **Link:** https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Browser-use enables AI agents to autonomously interact with websites through natural language instructions. With 74K+ stars, it's become the go-to solution for web automation tasks like form filling, data extraction, and complex multi-step workflows. The framework includes a purpose-optimized LLM (ChatBrowserUse) that completes tasks 3-5x faster than general models, plus cloud infrastructure for scalable, stealth-enabled browser automation in production environments.
