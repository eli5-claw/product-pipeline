## Agno (formerly Phidata)
• **Summary:** A programming language for building agentic software — multi-modal agents with memory, knowledge, tools, and reasoning at scale.
• **Link:** https://github.com/agno-agi/agno
• **Category:** AI/ML Framework
• **Why it matters:** Agno represents a paradigm shift from deterministic request-response software to reasoning systems that plan, call tools, and make decisions. With built-in AgentOS for production deployment, approval workflows, and native MCP integration, it's positioned as the infrastructure layer for the emerging agentic economy. The framework supports 50+ APIs and runs entirely in your own infrastructure.

## olmOCR
• **Summary:** A toolkit for converting PDFs and image-based documents into clean, structured Markdown using a 7B parameter vision language model.
• **Link:** https://github.com/allenai/olmocr
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Document parsing has been a bottleneck for AI workflows — olmOCR solves this with state-of-the-art accuracy (82.4% on olmOCR-Bench) at under $200 per million pages. It handles equations, tables, handwriting, and complex multi-column layouts. The recent v0.4.0 release introduced RL training, pushing performance up by ~4 points. Critical infrastructure for RAG and document AI pipelines.

## Reth (Rust Ethereum)
• **Summary:** A modular, blazing-fast Ethereum execution client built in Rust by Paradigm — production-ready and designed for high-performance node operations.
• **Link:** https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
• **Category:** Blockchain Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Reth hit 1.0 production-ready status in June 2024 and is rapidly becoming the go-to client for RPC providers, MEV searchers, and indexers. Its modular architecture allows developers to import crates and innovate on top of them — from standalone P2P networks to custom database queries. Apache/MIT licensed and designed for client diversity, it strengthens Ethereum's antifragility while delivering 10x performance improvements in many workloads.

## Drift Protocol v2
• **Summary:** A decentralized perpetual futures DEX on Solana with up to 10x leverage, institutional-grade liquidity, and open-source SDKs.
• **Link:** https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v2
• **Category:** DeFi / Blockchain
• **Why it matters:** Drift has emerged as one of Solana's DeFi success stories, regularly surpassing $300M in daily trading volume. The v2 protocol offers a complete suite: spot markets, perpetual futures, borrow/lend, and cross-collateral. With sub-second finality and low fees on Solana, it's demonstrating that high-performance DeFi can compete with centralized exchanges. The open-source SDK and example bots lower the barrier for market makers and integrators.

## vLLM
• **Summary:** A high-throughput, memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs featuring PagedAttention and continuous batching.
• **Link:** https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** vLLM has become the de facto standard for open-source LLM serving, delivering 5-10x throughput improvements over naive implementations through its revolutionary PagedAttention memory management. Originally from UC Berkeley's Sky Computing Lab, it now supports 50+ model architectures, multi-GPU distributed inference, and hardware backends including AMD, Intel, and TPUs. Essential infrastructure for anyone running LLMs in production at scale.
