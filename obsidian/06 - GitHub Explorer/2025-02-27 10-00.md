## SpacetimeDB
• **Summary:** A database and server combined into one — relational DB that runs application logic directly inside via stored procedure "modules"
• **Link:** https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
• **Category:** Infrastructure / Database
• **Why it matters:** Eliminates the need for separate web/game servers by letting clients connect directly to the database. Entire applications can be written in Rust and deployed as a single binary. Powers the MMORPG BitCraft Online entirely — no other servers needed. Optimized for real-time apps like games, chat, and collaboration tools with in-memory state and WAL persistence.

## DeerFlow
• **Summary:** ByteDance's open-source "super agent harness" that orchestrates sub-agents, memory, and sandboxes for complex multi-step tasks
• **Link:** https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow
• **Category:** AI/ML / Agent Framework
• **Why it matters:** Represents the evolution from simple "deep research" tools to full agent harnesses. Built on LangGraph/LangChain, it includes filesystem, memory, skills, sandboxed execution, and sub-agent spawning. Skills load progressively to keep context windows lean. The 2.0 rewrite shows how quickly the agent infrastructure space is maturing.

## AI Hedge Fund
• **Summary:** Educational AI-powered hedge fund simulation with 18 specialized agents mimicking legendary investors
• **Link:** https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund
• **Category:** DeFi/Blockchain / AI Finance
• **Why it matters:** Demonstrates multi-agent collaboration in financial decision-making with agents modeled after Warren Buffett, Cathie Wood, Michael Burry, and others. Each agent has distinct investment philosophies — value investing, growth, contrarian, macro — that debate and vote on trades. A fascinating example of AI agents applied to complex, high-stakes domains.

## Moonshine
• **Summary:** Fast, accurate on-device ASR (automatic speech recognition) optimized for real-time streaming voice applications
• **Link:** https://github.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine
• **Category:** AI/ML / Voice
• **Why it matters:** Outperforms Whisper Large V3 with 245M parameters vs 1.5B, while being 100x faster on MacBook Pro (107ms vs 11,286ms latency). Designed specifically for live streaming — unlike Whisper's fixed 30-second window, Moonshine caches computations and processes while users are still talking. Supports 8+ languages with better accuracy on Asian languages. Runs on everything from Raspberry Pi to iOS/Android.

## Superpowers
• **Summary:** A complete software development workflow framework for coding agents built on composable "skills"
• **Link:** https://github.com/obra/superpowers
• **Category:** Developer Tools / AI Workflow
• **Why it matters:** Brings structure to AI-assisted coding with mandatory workflows: brainstorming → design validation → implementation planning → subagent-driven development → TDD → code review. Skills trigger automatically based on context. Available for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode. Represents a maturation from "vibe coding" to systematic, production-ready agent workflows.
