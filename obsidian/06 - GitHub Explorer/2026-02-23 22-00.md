## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers
• **Summary:** Official collection of reference implementations for the Model Context Protocol, enabling seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources/tools.
• **Link:** https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** MCP is becoming the standard protocol for AI agent tool integration. This repository provides reference servers for filesystem, Git, PostgreSQL, Brave Search, and more. With 79k+ stars across the ecosystem, it's rapidly becoming the "USB-C for AI agents" - allowing any LLM to securely access tools and data sources through a standardized interface.

## Uniswap v4 Core
• **Summary:** Next-generation automated market maker (AMM) protocol with extensible hooks and singleton architecture for customizable DeFi pools.
• **Link:** https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core
• **Category:** DeFi/Blockchain
• **Why it matters:** Uniswap v4 introduces a revolutionary hook system that allows developers to customize pool behavior at every lifecycle stage - from before/after swaps to liquidity modifications. The singleton architecture dramatically reduces gas costs by ~30% compared to v3. This is the foundation for the next wave of DeFi innovation, enabling novel use cases like dynamic fees, impermanent loss protection, and MEV mitigation.

## MetaGPT
• **Summary:** Multi-agent framework that simulates an entire software company with product managers, architects, and engineers to build complex projects from a single prompt.
• **Link:** https://github.com/FoundationAgents/MetaGPT
• **Category:** AI/ML Framework
• **Why it matters:** MetaGPT represents a paradigm shift in AI-assisted development. Instead of a single LLM, it orchestrates multiple specialized agents that collaborate through standardized operating procedures (SOPs). The framework can generate user stories, competitive analysis, data structures, APIs, and complete codebases from a one-line requirement. Recently launched MGX (MetaGPT X) - the world's first AI agent development team.

## VictoriaMetrics
• **Summary:** Fast, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring solution for time series data - a high-performance alternative to Prometheus.
• **Link:** https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics
• **Category:** Developer Tools/Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** VictoriaMetrics handles 10x more metrics per CPU core than Prometheus while using 7x less RAM. It supports both single-node and clustered deployments with native PromQL support. With the explosion of observability data in cloud-native environments, VictoriaMetrics offers a compelling solution for teams drowning in monitoring costs. The project recently hit 14.89k GitHub stars and is becoming the go-to choice for high-scale metrics storage.

## Appwrite
• **Summary:** Complete open-source backend platform for web, mobile, and AI apps - providing Auth, Databases, Storage, Functions, and Messaging in one package.
• **Link:** https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite
• **Category:** Developer Tools/Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Appwrite is the "Firebase alternative that developers actually love." It provides a complete backend infrastructure with a beautiful developer experience, self-hosting capabilities, and zero vendor lock-in. With 46k+ GitHub stars and a thriving community, it's becoming the standard for rapid application development. The platform recently expanded its AI capabilities, making it ideal for building AI-powered applications without managing complex infrastructure.
