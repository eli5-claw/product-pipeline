## Alith
• **Summary:** AI agent framework designed for Web3 and Crypto, enabling developers to build, deploy, and manage on-chain AI agents.
• **Link:** https://github.com/0xLazAI/alith
• **Category:** DeFi/Blockchain + AI/ML
• **Why it matters:** Alith bridges the gap between AI and blockchain by providing a modular framework for creating DeFi trading bots, NFT analyzers, and DAO governance tools. It supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama, Grok) and offers cross-language SDKs for Rust, Python, and Node.js. The integration with TEE-based secure computing makes it particularly compelling for privacy-sensitive financial applications.

## Reth
• **Summary:** Modular, contributor-friendly and blazing-fast implementation of the Ethereum protocol in Rust.
• **Link:** https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
• **Category:** DeFi/Blockchain
• **Why it matters:** Reth represents a paradigm shift in Ethereum node implementations, built from the ground up for performance and modularity. Production-ready since June 2024, it's already being used by professional node operators for staking, MEV, and high-frequency trading. Its library-first architecture allows developers to import and remix components for custom P2P networks or specialized blockchain tooling.

## Uniswap v4 Core
• **Summary:** New automated market maker protocol with extensible and customizable pools via hooks architecture.
• **Link:** https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core
• **Category:** DeFi/Blockchain
• **Why it matters:** Uniswap v4 introduces "hooks" — plugins that allow developers to customize pool behavior at key lifecycle points (before/after swaps, liquidity additions, etc.). This singleton architecture with customizable callbacks enables novel DeFi primitives like dynamic fees, limit orders, and custom oracles. It's a fundamental evolution in DEX design that could reshape on-chain liquidity.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers
• **Summary:** Official reference implementations and SDKs for the Model Context Protocol — an open standard for connecting LLMs to external data and tools.
• **Link:** https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** MCP, originally created by Anthropic and now donated to the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (Dec 2025), is becoming the "USB-C for AI agents." It standardizes how LLMs connect to databases, file systems, APIs, and tools. With official SDKs in 9+ languages and a rapidly growing ecosystem of third-party servers, MCP is poised to become the foundational interoperability layer for AI applications.

## Zed
• **Summary:** High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
• **Link:** https://github.com/zed-industries/zed
• **Category:** Developer Tools
• **Why it matters:** Zed is reimagining the code editor for the AI era with native multiplayer collaboration, GPU-accelerated rendering, and deep AI integration. Built in Rust for maximum performance, it offers real-time collaborative editing with CRDTs and is actively developing agentic AI features for project-aware coding. As a spiritual successor to Atom, it represents the next evolution in developer tooling.
