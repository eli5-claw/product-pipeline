## Coinbase AgentKit
• **Summary:** Framework-agnostic toolkit for giving AI agents crypto wallets and onchain interactions
• **Link:** https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit
• **Category:** DeFi/Blockchain/Web3
• **Why it matters:** AgentKit bridges the gap between AI agents and blockchain, enabling fee-free stablecoin payments and seamless monetization of AI agents. It supports multiple frameworks (LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI Agents SDK) and wallet providers, making it a crucial infrastructure piece for the emerging AI + Web3 economy.

## Unsloth
• **Summary:** Fine-tuning & Reinforcement Learning for LLMs with 2x speed and 70% less VRAM
• **Link:** https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Unsloth democratizes LLM fine-tuning by making it accessible on consumer hardware. It supports cutting-edge models like DeepSeek, GPT-OSS, Qwen, and Llama with optimized Triton kernels. The recent addition of Vision RL and FP8 reinforcement learning on consumer GPUs makes it a game-changer for researchers and developers.

## Daytona
• **Summary:** Secure and elastic infrastructure for running AI-generated code with sub-90ms sandbox creation
• **Link:** https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona
• **Category:** Developer Tools/Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Daytona solves the critical security challenge of executing AI-generated code by providing isolated, OCI-compatible sandboxes. With support for Python, TypeScript, and Go SDKs, it enables massive parallelization for concurrent AI workflows—essential infrastructure as AI coding assistants become mainstream.

## Zep
• **Summary:** End-to-end context engineering platform with temporal knowledge graphs for AI agents
• **Link:** https://github.com/getzep/zep
• **Category:** AI/ML Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** Zep solves the "agent context problem" by maintaining relationship-aware knowledge graphs that understand how context evolves over time. With sub-200ms latency and Graph RAG capabilities, it enables AI agents to have genuine memory and context awareness—critical for production-grade agent systems.

## Dagger
• **Summary:** Programmable CI/CD platform that runs locally, in CI, or in the cloud with 8 language SDKs
• **Link:** https://github.com/dagger/dagger
• **Category:** Developer Tools/DevOps
• **Why it matters:** Dagger replaces brittle shell scripts and YAML with type-safe, containerized workflows. Its unique approach of content-addressed caching and OpenTelemetry observability makes software delivery truly repeatable. The ability to run identical pipelines locally and in CI eliminates the "works on my machine" problem.
