## ElizaOS
• **Summary:** Multi-agent AI framework for building autonomous agents with Web3 integration
• **Link:** https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza
• **Category:** AI/ML - Agent Framework
• **Why it matters:** ElizaOS has become the dominant open-source framework for AI agents, powering projects like ai16z. It uniquely bridges AI and Web3, enabling autonomous agents that can interact with blockchain protocols, Discord, Telegram, and more. The framework supports multiple LLM providers and offers both TypeScript and Python implementations.

## vLLM
• **Summary:** High-throughput LLM inference and serving engine with PagedAttention
• **Link:** https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm
• **Category:** AI/ML - Inference Infrastructure
• **Why it matters:** vLLM revolutionized LLM serving with its PagedAttention algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art throughput for inference workloads. It supports continuous batching, speculative decoding, and distributed inference across multiple GPUs. Used by major AI platforms, it's become the de facto standard for production LLM serving.

## Ollama
• **Summary:** Get up and running with large language models locally
• **Link:** https://github.com/ollama/ollama
• **Category:** AI/ML - Local LLM Runtime
• **Why it matters:** Ollama made running open-source LLMs locally accessible to everyone. With a simple CLI and extensive model library, it abstracts away the complexity of model quantization and inference. Its REST API and broad ecosystem integration (VS Code, Obsidian, various chat UIs) make it a cornerstone of the local AI movement.

## Dagger
• **Summary:** Programmable CI/CD engine that runs pipelines in containers
• **Link:** https://github.com/dagger/dagger
• **Category:** Dev Tools - CI/CD
• **Why it matters:** Dagger brings modern software engineering practices to CI/CD by making pipelines programmable in real code (Go, Python, TypeScript, etc.) instead of YAML. With content-addressed caching and local-first execution, it eliminates "works on my machine" issues between local dev and CI environments. The OpenTelemetry integration provides unprecedented observability into build pipelines.

## Temporal
• **Summary:** Durable execution platform for reliable, scalable applications
• **Link:** https://github.com/temporalio/temporal
• **Category:** Infrastructure - Distributed Systems
• **Why it matters:** Temporal solves the hardest problem in distributed systems: handling failures gracefully. Originally from Uber's Cadence, it provides durable execution where workflows survive process crashes, network failures, and infrastructure outages. It's becoming essential for microservices orchestration, data pipelines, and any long-running business processes that must be reliable.
