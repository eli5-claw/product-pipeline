- No user funds were lost; the exchange's crisis response was widely praised

### 2. U.S. Regulatory Environment Improves Significantly

The SEC under acting Chairman Uyeda has begun a major shift in crypto policy:

- **Enforcement Actions Ended/Paused:** Investigations into Coinbase, Binance, OpenSea, Uniswap, Consensys, and Robinhood were ended or paused
- **Dealer Rule Dropped:** SEC dropped its appeal in the controversial "dealer rule" lawsuit that would have subjected DeFi protocols to traditional securities regulation
- **New Cyber Unit:** Creation of a Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit to replace the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, refocusing on criminal misconduct while allowing legitimate development

**Stablecoin Legislation:** The bipartisan GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) was introduced, providing a comprehensive framework requiring stablecoins to be backed 1:1 by Treasury bills, insured deposits, or related instruments.

**Stablecoin Transaction Volume:** Currently processing 100+ million transactions monthly totaling ~$600 billion (adjusted for HFT/bots).

### 3. Bitcoin Dominance Reaches Multi-Year Highs

**Source:** Crypto.com Research, Delphi Digital

Bitcoin dominance reached **62%** on February 25, 2025 — the highest level since February 2021:

- Bitcoin-gold correlation hit 0.52, the highest since 2020, reinforcing "digital gold" narrative
- Bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio has increased exponentially due to halvings, potentially rivaling gold in scarcity
- BTC and equity performance correlation remains lower than BTC-gold correlation
- ETH, XRP, and SOL combined market cap is only 28% of Bitcoin's as of February 2025

**Institutional Adoption:**
- Mubadala Investment Company (Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund) disclosed Bitcoin ETP investments in Q4 2024 13F filings
- U.S. foundations and university endowments began investing or considering allocations
- BlackRock added 1-2% Bitcoin allocation to target model portfolio

### 4. Solana Ecosystem Cools as Memecoin Mania Fades

The Solana ecosystem experienced a significant cooldown in February:

- **Trading Volume Collapse:** Solana DEX volume dropped 95% from ~$2B (November 2024) to ~$26M (mid-February 2025)
- **Active Addresses:** Fell to 12-month low of ~3.3M, down from ~9M in January 2025
- **Memecoin Impact:** The $TRUMP and $MELANIA token launches initially drove 320% spike in weekly DEX volume, but sentiment turned after the Argentine President Milei memecoin scandal and related promoter malpractice disclosures
- **Popular Memecoins:** Declined 15-35% in valuation

**Long-term Perspective:** Solana remains a leading blockchain in DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) and other categories; lower memecoin activity doesn't materially affect SOL's long-term investment thesis.
