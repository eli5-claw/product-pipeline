## 1. OpenAI to Launch AI Smart Speaker with Camera in 2027

OpenAI is reportedly preparing to enter the consumer hardware market with its first device: an AI-powered smart speaker featuring a built-in camera. The device, designed by former Apple design chief Jony Ive's team at LoveFrom, is expected to retail between $200-$300 and won't ship until early 2027 at the earliest.

Key features include:
- Integrated camera for analyzing surroundings and identifying objects
- Facial recognition (similar to Apple's Face ID) for purchase authentication
- Deep research capabilities powered by OpenAI's models

This marks OpenAI's most significant hardware push following its $6.5 billion acquisition of Ive's startup, io Products, in 2025. The company is also reportedly developing AI-powered smart glasses (targeting 2028) and a "smart lamp" concept still in prototype stage.
