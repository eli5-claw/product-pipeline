## Summary of the Most Important Tech Stories

### 1. **Global AI Memory Chip Shortage Intensifies**
Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has warned of a severe shortage of high-end memory chips (HBM) that has become a major "choke point" for the entire AI industry. Even tech giants like Google with massive resources are feeling the squeeze. Only three companies—Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix—manufacture these critical chips, and they are struggling to keep up with demand. This shortage is causing costs to skyrocket and forcing consumer electronics companies to raise prices. The crisis could last until 2030 or longer, with predictions that many system vendors may go bankrupt due to lack of memory supply.

### 2. **Nvidia Expands CPU Ambitions with Meta Partnership**
Nvidia has announced a "multigenerational" deal with Meta to supply millions of chips, including not just GPUs but also CPUs—a market traditionally dominated by Intel and AMD. This partnership will see Meta deploy Nvidia's next-generation Vera CPUs alongside Blackwell and Rubin AI chips in its data centers. The move signals Nvidia's aggressive expansion into Intel and AMD's home turf, potentially reshaping the data center processor landscape. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also teased "several new chips the world has never seen before" to be unveiled at GTC 2026 in March.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week, gathering CEOs from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other major tech companies. Despite some logistical challenges and high-profile dropouts (including Nvidia's Jensen Huang), the summit showcased India's growing influence in the global AI race. Mukesh Ambani pledged $110 billion for AI projects across India over the next seven years. The summit highlighted India's positioning as a tech alternative to the US-China duopoly, with a focus on AI for the Global South and voice-based AI solutions for non-English speakers.

### 4. **NASA Artemis 2 Mission Delayed**
NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman announced that the Artemis 2 mission—the first crewed flyby mission to the Moon in over 50 years—has been delayed due to technical issues with helium flow to the SLS rocket. The March launch window is no longer viable, with the mission now likely pushed to April 2026 or later. The setback comes as China accelerates its own lunar program, with an uncrewed Chang'e 7 mission expected in 2026 and crewed spacecraft testing underway.

ByteDance's new AI video generation model, Seedance 2.0, has gone viral but is facing serious copyright challenges. Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter over alleged unauthorized use of Disney characters, and the Motion Picture Association has urged ByteDance to stop the service over "massive scale" copyright infringement. SAG-AFTRA also criticized the model for unauthorized use of members' voices and likenesses. Despite the controversy, the model represents a significant advancement in AI video generation with multimodal capabilities.
