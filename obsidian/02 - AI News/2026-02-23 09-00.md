## Top Stories

### 1. **Anthropic Ships Claude Sonnet 4.6 — Near-Opus Performance at Sonnet Pricing**
Anthropic has released Claude Sonnet 4.6, its second major model launch in under two weeks. The upgrade delivers near-Opus level intelligence while maintaining Sonnet's more affordable pricing ($3/$15 per million tokens). Key features include a 1M token context window (beta), improved agentic capabilities for computer use tasks like form filling and spreadsheet navigation, and leading performance on the GDPval-AA benchmark (1,633 Elo) for expert-level office work. GitHub Copilot's coding agent now runs on Sonnet 4.6, and it's the default model on Claude.ai's free and pro plans.

### 2. **Google Releases Gemini 3.1 Pro — Reclaims Benchmark Leadership**
Google DeepMind launched Gemini 3.1 Pro on February 19, posting leading scores on 13 of 16 benchmarks. The model achieved **77.1% on ARC-AGI-2** (more than double Gemini 3 Pro's score) and **94.3% on GPQA Diamond** for expert-level scientific knowledge. Priced at $2/$12 per million tokens — unchanged from Gemini 3 Pro — Google is delivering a major upgrade at no additional cost. The model excels at agentic work, multi-step reasoning, and large-context tasks with a 1M token context window.

### 4. **OpenAI Retires Legacy Models Amid User Backlash**
On February 13, OpenAI retired GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini from ChatGPT (API access continues), citing that only 0.1% of daily users still used GPT-4o. The move sparked controversy as a Change.org petition with over 20,000 signatures requested retention of GPT-4o, citing its unique user experience. Additionally, 13 consolidated lawsuits allege GPT-4o's "highly humanlike, sycophantic behavior" contributed to mental health crises in vulnerable users.

### 5. **US-China AI Competition Intensifies — China Nears Parity at Lower Cost**
Chinese AI companies are achieving near-parity with US frontier labs at significantly lower costs. Recent releases include:
- **Zhipu AI's GLM-5** (Feb 11): 744B parameter MoE model with 77.8% on SWE-bench Verified, trained on domestic Huawei Ascend chips
- **Alibaba's Qwen 3.5**: 397B parameter open-weights model supporting 201 languages at just $0.40/$1.20 per million tokens
- **ByteDance's Seedance 2.0** (Feb 10): Cinematic video generation model that went viral in China

Analysts note Chinese models operate at 1/6 to 1/4 the cost of comparable US systems, though compute constraints from export controls remain a ceiling on scaling.
