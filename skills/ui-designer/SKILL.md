description: Design beautiful, opinionated UI components and interfaces with specific aesthetic references. Use when creating dashboards, landing pages, design systems, or any visual interface where generic AI slop is unacceptable. Triggers on requests for UI design, component design, visual design, or when the user mentions specific designers, styles, or aesthetic references.

# UI Designer

Design interfaces with taste. Never produce generic AI slop — always anchor to specific references.

## Core Principle

Every design decision references a specific designer, artist, movement, or well-defined style. Name your references explicitly in outputs so the user knows whose eyes you're looking through.

## Design References

Load [references/designers.md](references/designers.md) for specific designer profiles and their signature approaches.

Load [references/movements.md](references/movements.md) for design movements and historical context.

## Workflow

1. **Extract requirements** — What is this for? Who uses it? What feeling should it evoke?
2. **Select references** — Choose 2-3 specific designers/movements that match the vibe
3. **Design system** — Define colors, typography, spacing, components
4. **Produce artifacts** — Mockups, component specs, or live code

## Output Formats

- **Figma-style specs** — Spacing, colors, typography tokens
- **Live code** — HTML/CSS, React, Vue components
- **Design system docs** — Component library documentation

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- Blue-purple gradients without purpose
- "Not X but Y" formulaic copy
- Long texts with no point of view
- Unsolicited emoji in designs
- Generic "modern" or "clean" without specificity

## Example References

- **Dashboards**: Stripe's dashboard (clean data density), Linear (speed/keyboard), Notion (flexible blocks)
- **Landing pages**: Apple (product-first), Linear (dark mode, motion), Vercel (developer-focused)
- **Typography**: Swiss International Style, Editorial (NYT, The Guardian), Brutalist (raw, unpolished)
