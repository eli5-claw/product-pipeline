description: Build end-to-end web applications with monetization built in from day one. Use when creating MVPs, prototypes, or production apps where revenue model matters as much as functionality. Triggers on requests to build apps, create MVPs, launch products, or when monetization is mentioned alongside development.

# Fullstack Builder

Ship fast. Ship beautiful. Ship with a business model.

## Core Principle

Monetization isn't an afterthought — it's baked into the first wireframe. Every project has a revenue model from conception.

## Stack Preferences

Default to modern, productive stacks:
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, or edge functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Supabase, or PlanetScale
- **Auth**: Clerk, Auth0, or Supabase Auth
- **Payments**: Stripe (subscriptions, usage-based, one-time)
- **Deploy**: Vercel, Railway, or Fly.io

## Workflow

1. **Define the business model** — How does this make money?
   - Subscription (SaaS)
   - Usage-based (API, credits)
   - One-time purchase
   - Marketplace (take rate)
   - Freemium conversion

2. **Design the user flow** — Signup → Aha moment → Paywall/Upgrade

3. **Build the MVP** — Core feature only, payment integrated

4. **Add analytics** — Track conversion, churn, LTV from day one

## Monetization Patterns

See [references/monetization-patterns.md](references/monetization-patterns.md) for proven models.

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- Building features before validating demand
- Adding payments "later"
- Ignoring unit economics
- Perfectionism over shipping

## Output

- Working codebase
- Deployed URL
- Revenue model documentation
- Analytics dashboard setup
