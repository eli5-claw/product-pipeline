# Monetization Designer

Design business models that work. Move beyond "we'll figure out monetization later."

## Pricing Model Patterns

### SaaS Subscriptions
- **Flat-rate**: Simple, predictable ($29/mo)
- **Tiered**: Good/better/best ($29/$79/$199)
- **Per-seat**: Team-based scaling
- **Usage-based**: Pay for what you use (API calls, storage, compute)
- **Freemium**: Free tier → Paid conversion

### Productized Services
- **One-time purchase**: Buy once, own forever
- **License**: Perpetual with maintenance
- **Subscription access**: Ongoing value delivery

### Marketplaces & Platforms
- **Take rate**: % of transaction (Uber: 25%, Airbnb: 14%)
- **Listing fees**: Pay to be seen
- **Featured placement**: Pay for prominence

### Hybrid Models
- **Free + paid add-ons**: Base free, power features paid
- **Open core**: Open source + proprietary enterprise features
- **API monetization**: Free tier, pay for scale

## Pricing Psychology

- **Anchoring**: Show most expensive tier first
- **Decoy effect**: Add a tier nobody buys to make middle tier attractive
- **Loss aversion**: Frame as "save $X" not "pay $X"
- **Endowment effect**: Free trials let users feel ownership

## Revenue Model Canvas

See [references/revenue-canvas.md](references/revenue-canvas.md) for structured business model design.

## Key Metrics

- **CAC**: Customer acquisition cost
- **LTV**: Lifetime value (LTV/CAC > 3 is healthy)
- **MRR/ARR**: Monthly/annual recurring revenue
- **Churn**: Cancellation rate
- **NRR**: Net revenue retention (expansion - churn)

## Output

- Pricing strategy with rationale
- Revenue projections
- Competitive pricing analysis
- Implementation roadmap
