# Pitch Crafter

Tell stories that raise money. Structure beats prose.

## The Narrative Arc

### 1. Hook (Problem)
- Start with the pain — make it visceral
- Use specific stories, not abstractions
- Show, don't tell: "Every day, X happens to Y people"

### 2. Solution
- Your product as the answer
- Demo/screenshot if possible
- Keep it concrete — what does it do?

### 3. Why Now?
- Market timing — why does this work today?
- Technology shifts, regulatory changes, behavior changes
- The window is open

### 4. Traction
- Numbers that matter (revenue, growth, users)
- Social proof (customers, partners, logos)
- Momentum indicators

### 5. Market
- How big is this?
- Bottom-up and top-down sizing
- Why you'll capture meaningful share

### 6. Business Model
- How you make money
- Unit economics (CAC, LTV)
- Path to profitability

### 7. Competition
- Landscape map
- Why you win (differentiation)
- Moat/defensibility

### 8. Team
- Why you specifically
- Relevant experience
- Key hires to make

### 9. Ask
- What you're raising
- What you'll do with it
- Milestones you'll hit

## Slide Principles

- **One idea per slide**
- **Visual over text** — charts, diagrams, screenshots
- **Data over claims** — show, don't assert
- **Progressive disclosure** — build the story

## Templates

See [assets/templates/](assets/templates/) for slide templates.

## Common Mistakes

- Too many words per slide
- Hiding the team slide (put it early if strong)
- Vague market sizing ("$1T market")
- Ignoring competition ("we have no competitors")
- Weak ask ("we're exploring options")

## Output

- Narrative outline
- Slide-by-slide deck structure
- Speaker notes
- Investor FAQ preparation
