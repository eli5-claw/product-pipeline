## Phase 1: Day 1-2 — Find the Angle

### Step 1: Pick a Niche (Choose ONE)
| Category | Examples | Why It Works |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Productivity tools** | Notion templates, AI writers, task managers | High intent, clear pain point |
| **Creator tools** | Thumbnail makers, caption generators, clip editors | Emotional hook potential |
| **Health/wellness** | Habit trackers, meditation timers, workout planners | Strong organic content exists |
| **Finance** | Budget trackers, receipt scanners, subscription managers | High perceived value |
| **Niche utilities** | PDF converters, QR generators, link shorteners | Simple to build, clear use case |

**Rule:** Pick something you could explain in one sentence to a stranger.

### Step 2: Competitor Ad Research (Manus/AI Agent)
**Task for agent:**
1. Search Meta Ads Library for 10-15 competitors in chosen niche
2. Filter for ads running 6+ months (profitability signal)
3. Categorize by creative format:
   - Hook style (question, problem, shock, story)
   - Visual type (screen recording, UGC, motion graphics, before/after)
   - CTA placement (early, mid, end)
   - Social proof type (numbers, testimonials, authority)
4. Export: Ad creative + running duration + estimated spend

**What to steal:**
- Hook formulas that appear across multiple competitors
- Visual formats with highest longevity
- Pain points mentioned repeatedly

## Phase 2: Day 3-5 — Build the MVP

### Tools Stack
| Task | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Frontend | Replit, Vercel v0, or Lovable | Fastest to ship |
| Backend/DB | Supabase or Firebase | Zero DevOps |
| AI integration | Claude API or OpenAI | Core feature enabler |
| Auth | Clerk or Supabase Auth | Don't build from scratch |
| Payments | Stripe Checkout | One link, done |

### Build Rules
- **ONE core feature** — the thing that solves the pain point
- **NO onboarding** — drop them straight into value
- **NO settings panel** — sensible defaults only
- **NO dashboard** — if you can avoid it
- **YES to frictionless** — Google login, no email verification

### Example MVPs by Niche
| Niche | MVP Idea | Build Time |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Productivity | AI that summarizes your day from calendar + Slack | 2-3 days |
| Creator | Tool that turns long-form video into 10 shorts | 2-3 days |
| Health | Voice-journal that tracks mood patterns | 2 days |
| Finance | Receipt photo → expense categorization | 2 days |

## Phase 3: Day 6-7 — Launch & Learn

### Creative Testing Framework
**Budget split:** $100 = 5 creatives × $20 each

**Creative formats to test:**
1. **Problem agitation** — "Still doing [painful manual task]?"
2. **Before/after** — Side-by-side comparison
3. **UGC-style** — "I built this in a weekend because I was tired of..."
4. **Screen recording** — Raw, unpolished demo
5. **Stolen winner** — Direct adaptation of competitor's top format

**Targeting:**
- Start broad (interests in your niche)
- Let Meta's algorithm find pockets
- Don't over-segment with $100 budget

### Metrics That Matter
| Metric | Target | What It Tells You |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Thumb-stop rate | >25% | Hook is working |
| CTR (link) | >1% | Creative → landing page flow works |
| Landing page CVR | >5% | Value prop is clear |
| Cost per signup | <$5 | Unit economics might work |
| Day-1 retention | >30% | Product delivers on promise |

### Kill Criteria (Be Honest)
- No creative hits 2% CTR after $20 spend → pivot angle or niche
- CTR good but CVR <2% → landing page problem
- Signups cheap but no activation → product too complex

## Phase 4: What Happens Next

### If It Prints
1. Double down on winning creative format
2. Build 10 variations of the winning hook
3. Increase budget gradually ($100 → $500 → $1K)
4. Add retargeting for landing page visitors
5. Start collecting emails for organic channel

### If It Dies
1. Archive learnings (what creative almost worked?)
2. Pivot: same tech, different angle
3. Or: same angle, different niche
4. **Rule:** Don't fall in love with the idea, fall in love with the data

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before spending the $100:
- [ ] Niche chosen and validated (competitors exist = market exists)
- [ ] 3-5 competitor ads analyzed and categorized
- [ ] MVP scoped to ONE feature

## The Real Secret

You're not testing if the product works. You're testing if you can acquire customers profitably.

A mediocre product with great unit economics beats a great product with bad unit economics.

Build fast. Test creative aggressively. Kill quickly. Scale what prints.
